#   2) Some interresting insights about how the non-local assignment operator
#   '<<-' works can be found at

makeCacheMatrix <- function(mat = matrix()) {
    # This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse,
    # thus speeding up the repeated usage of this inverse matrix.
    #
    # Args: 
    #   x: a square invertible R matrix.
    #
    # Returns:
    #   A special "matrix" object that is a list indeed.
    
    mat.inverse <- NULL
    set <- function(m) {
        mat <<- m
        mat.inverse <<- NULL
    }
}

cacheSolve <- function(mat, ...) {
    # Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. 
    # If the inverse has already been calculated and the matrix has not changed, 
    # then the cachesolve function retrieves the inverse from the cache,
    # otherwise, it computes it and caches it.
    #
    # Args:
    #   x: a special "matrix" object made by makeCacheMatrix.
    #
    # Returns:
    #   The inverse matrix of x.
